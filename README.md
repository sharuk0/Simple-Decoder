# Text Decoder

This is a simple Python script that allows you to decode text using various methods, including Base64, Base32, ASCII, hexadecimal, octal, and binary.
Requirements

The script utilizes Python's standard library, so no additional installation is required.
Usage

    Run the text_decoder.py script.
    You will be prompted to paste the text you want to decode.
    Select the desired decoding method by entering the corresponding number.
    The script will display the decoded text in the console.

# Available Decoding Methods

    Base64: Decodes the text using the Base64 encoding scheme.
    Base32: Decodes the text using the Base32 encoding scheme.
    ASCII: Decodes the text by interpreting each number as the corresponding ASCII code.
    Hexadecimal: Decodes the text by interpreting each pair of digits as a byte in hexadecimal format.
    Octal: Decodes the text by interpreting each number as a byte in octal format.
    Binary: Decodes the text by interpreting each sequence of 8 bits as a byte in binary format.

# Notes

    If the text cannot be decoded using the selected method, a message indicating that decoding was not possible will be displayed.
    The script is designed for quick decoding and is not suitable for intensive or production use.

Enjoy decoding your texts with this script!
